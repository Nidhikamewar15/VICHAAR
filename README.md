# Introduction
The aim of this project is to help users in collecting opinions or voices of the people about an
issue through online instead of manually taking the feedback or manually conducting an opinion
poll. This reduces the waste of time to request the people and get them to participate in this poll
by manually coming and disturbing their works. And it is a tedious process to calculate and get
the final result of the poll and also to get the immediate access to your real time results.
Users can SignUp/Login, create surveys, update surveys and take surveys. They can
change the background colour and the font of the form.
